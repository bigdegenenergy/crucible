> # Booksplode: A Universal Workflow for Deep Book Research

**Booksplode** is a systematic workflow for conducting comprehensive research on business books and applying their principles to specific industries or use cases. This repository provides a structured system for dissecting books, extracting key insights, and creating actionable reports.

The goal of the Booksplode system is to move beyond simple book summaries and create a deep, practical understanding of how to apply the book's ideas in the real world.

## How It Works

The Booksplode workflow is a 7-phase research process that covers:

1.  **Author Research**: Understanding the author's background and credibility.
2.  **Core Framework Extraction**: Identifying the book's central ideas and models.
3.  **Case Study Collection**: Gathering examples from the book.
4.  **Real-World Applications Research**: Finding how others have applied the ideas.
5.  **Critical Analysis**: Understanding the book's limitations and critiques.
6.  **Industry-Specific Application**: Applying the principles to a target industry.
7.  **Synthesis and Recommendations**: Creating a final, actionable report.

For a detailed breakdown of the workflow, see the [**BOOKSPLODE_WORKFLOW.md**](BOOKSPLODE_WORKFLOW.md) file.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized by book, with each book having its own dedicated folder. The folder naming convention is:

```
{author-last-name}_{book-title-slug}
```

For example, the folder for "Made to Stick" by Chip and Dan Heath is:

```
heath_made-to-stick/
```

Inside each book folder, you will find a series of numbered Markdown files corresponding to the 7 phases of the Booksplode workflow.
