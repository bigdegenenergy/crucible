# Made to Stick for the Mortgage Industry: A Framework for Memorable Communication

## 1. Introduction

The mortgage industry, while foundational to the economy, faces a significant and persistent communication crisis. The process is often perceived by consumers as complex, opaque, and stressful. Research from STRATMOR Group indicates that communication is the most frequently cited problem by mortgage borrowers, leading to extremely low Net Promoter Scores (NPS) and a high likelihood of negative word-of-mouth [1]. This report bridges the gap between this industry-wide challenge and the powerful communication framework presented by Chip and Dan Heath in their seminal book, *Made to Stick: Why Some Ideas Survive and Others Die* [2].

This document synthesizes extensive research on the *Made to Stick* principles, real-world applications, and critiques, and applies them directly to the unique challenges of the mortgage business. The goal is to provide a practical, actionable framework for mortgage professionals to transform their communication from forgettable and confusing to simple, memorable, and effective. By making mortgage concepts "sticky," lenders can not only improve customer satisfaction but also build a powerful engine for referrals and long-term growth.

## 2. The SUCCESs Framework: An Overview

Chip and Dan Heath identified six key principles that make ideas memorable and effective, or "sticky." These principles, forming the acronym SUCCESs, provide a checklist for crafting messages that resonate with an audience. The following table provides a brief overview of each principle.

| Principle | Description | Core Question to Ask |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **S**imple | Finding the core of the idea and stripping it down to its most critical essence. | What is the single most important thing? |
| **U**nexpected | Grabbing people's attention by surprising them and breaking their patterns of thinking. | How can I violate expectations? |
| **C**oncrete | Explaining ideas in terms of human actions and sensory information. | How can I make this tangible and real? |
| **C**redible | Giving an idea believability, using authorities, details, or testable credentials. | How can people trust my message? |
| **E**motional | Making people feel something, as emotions are a key driver of action and memory. | How can I make people care? |
| **S**tories | Using narratives to provide simulation (knowledge about how to act) and inspiration (motivation to act). | How can I use a story to get my idea across? |

## 3. The Mortgage Communication Crisis

The communication challenges in the mortgage industry are not just anecdotal; they are well-documented and have a significant impact on customer satisfaction and loyalty. The complexity of the product, combined with the high emotional and financial stakes for the borrower, creates a perfect storm for miscommunication.

> "Year to date, nearly one in four borrowers (24 percent) who had a problem in some area of their mortgage journey attributed it to communication issues. Not only was communication the most frequently cited issue, but it was also among the most damaging of problems, causing the Net Promoter Score (NPS) to drop to -60, all but negating a chance at a referral and more than likely causing negative word of mouth." [1]

This data from STRATMOR Group highlights the severity of the problem. The following table breaks down the key communication failures and their impact on NPS, a measure of customer loyalty.

| Communication Failure | Borrower Impact | NPS Drop |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Silence** | Borrower has to call for updates | 83 points |
| **Inaccurate Information** | Subsequent document requests not explained | 47 points |
| **Blame Shifting** | Originator blames underwriter for issues | NPS of -21 |
| **Lack of Preparation** | No call to review final numbers before closing | 98 points |

These statistics demonstrate a clear and urgent need for a new approach to communication in the mortgage industry. The *Made to Stick* framework provides a proven methodology to address these very issues.

## 4. Applying the SUCCESs Framework to the Mortgage Business

This section provides specific, actionable strategies for applying each of the *Made to Stick* principles to the mortgage process. The goal is to transform abstract, confusing concepts into simple, memorable, and impactful messages.

### 4.1. Simple: Finding the Core of the Mortgage Message

The mortgage process is inherently complex, but the core message for the borrower is simple: "We are helping you get into your new home." Every communication should be filtered through this lens. The following table provides examples of how to simplify common mortgage concepts.

| Complex Concept | Simple Analogy or Core Message |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Pre-Approval | "A pre-approval is like a VIP ticket to the home-buying concert. It shows sellers you're a serious buyer and can afford the ticket price." |
| Debt-to-Income (DTI) Ratio | "Your DTI is like a pie chart of your income. We need to make sure the 'debt' slice isn't so big that you don't have enough 'living' slice left over." |
| Closing Costs | "Closing costs are the 'move-in' fees for your new home. They cover all the people and services that help make the home officially yours." |

### 4.2. Unexpected: Grabbing Attention in a Sea of Sameness

The mortgage industry is not known for its creativity. This provides a massive opportunity to stand out by doing something unexpected. Consider the following ideas:

*   **The "No Jargon" Guarantee:** Launch a marketing campaign centered around a promise to communicate in plain English. This is unexpected in an industry built on jargon.
*   **The "Mortgage Unboxed" Video Series:** Create a series of short, humorous videos that "unbox" complex mortgage concepts. The unexpected format can make dry topics engaging.
*   **The "Surprise, Your Loan is Clear to Close!" Celebration Kit:** Instead of a dry email, send a small celebration kit to borrowers when their loan is clear to close. This unexpected gesture can create a memorable emotional peak.

### 4.3. Concrete: Making Abstract Numbers Tangible

Mortgages are a world of abstract numbers: interest rates, APRs, points, and loan amounts. To make these numbers meaningful, they must be made concrete. The following table shows how to translate abstract numbers into concrete terms.

| Abstract Number | Concrete Translation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| A 0.25% lower interest rate | "Saving 0.25% on your interest rate is like getting a free cup of coffee every day for the next 30 years." |
| Paying down your mortgage | "Every extra payment you make is like kicking a future mortgage payment out of your house forever." |
| The value of a 15-year vs. 30-year mortgage | "Choosing a 15-year mortgage is like taking the express train to financial freedom. It's a faster ride, but the ticket is a bit more expensive upfront." |

### 4.4. Credible: Building Trust in a Low-Trust Industry

Trust is a major issue in the financial services industry. Credibility can be built not just with authority, but with transparency and testable experiences.

*   **The "Transparent Mortgage" Portal:** Create a client portal that shows the loan process in real-time, with clear explanations of each stage. This transparency builds credibility.
*   **The "Will It Fund?" Challenge:** Similar to Blendtec's "Will It Blend?" campaign, create content that shows how you can get tough deals funded. This demonstrates your expertise and builds credibility.
*   **Use Anti-Authorities:** Instead of just testimonials from happy clients, feature a story of a client who had a difficult loan process and how you helped them through it. This can be more credible than a generic positive review.

### 4.5. Emotional: Connecting with the Dream of Homeownership

Buying a home is an emotional journey, but the mortgage process is often cold and transactional. By tapping into the emotions of the home-buying experience, you can create a much stickier message.

*   **Focus on the "Why":** Instead of focusing on the "what" (the loan), focus on the "why" (the home). Use language that evokes the feeling of being in a new home.
*   **The "First-Time Homebuyer Jitters" Guide:** Create a guide that acknowledges and addresses the fears and anxieties of first-time homebuyers. This shows empathy and builds an emotional connection.
*   **Celebrate Milestones:** The mortgage process has many milestones (pre-approval, clear to close, funding). Celebrate each one with the borrower to create a series of positive emotional moments.

### 4.6. Stories: Weaving a Narrative of Success

Stories are the most powerful tool in the *Made to Stick* arsenal. The entire mortgage process can be framed as a story, with the borrower as the hero.

*   **The Borrower's Journey:** Frame the loan process as a hero's journey, with challenges to overcome (document requests, underwriting) and a triumphant conclusion (getting the keys to the new home).
*   **The "Loan Officer as Guide" Story:** Position the loan officer not as a salesperson, but as a trusted guide who helps the hero navigate the journey.
*   **Use Customer Stories:** Instead of generic testimonials, tell the full story of a past client. What was their situation? What challenges did they face? How did you help them succeed?

## 5. Case Studies: Putting the Principles into Practice

To illustrate how these principles can be applied, here are two fictional case studies.

### Case Study 1: The "Simple Mortgage" Initiative

**Company:** Main Street Mortgages

**Problem:** High rate of borrower confusion and frustration, leading to low NPS.

**Solution:** Main Street Mortgages launched a "Simple Mortgage" initiative based on the principles of Simplicity and Concreteness.

*   **Actions:**
    *   They created a "Simple Mortgage Guide" that used analogies and simple language to explain every step of the process.
    *   They developed a series of short, animated videos that made abstract concepts like DTI and LTV concrete and understandable.
    *   They trained their loan officers to use a "one-sentence summary" at the end of every conversation to reinforce the core message.
*   **Results:**
    *   Borrower satisfaction scores increased by 30%.
    *   The time loan officers spent answering basic questions decreased by 50%.
    *   NPS improved from -20 to +50.

### Case Study 2: The "Unexpected Closer" Campaign

**Company:** Apex Home Loans

**Problem:** Low brand recognition and difficulty standing out in a crowded market.

**Solution:** Apex Home Loans launched an "Unexpected Closer" campaign based on the principles of Unexpectedness and Emotion.

*   **Actions:**
    *   When a loan was clear to close, they sent the borrower a surprise "Closing Celebration Kit" with champagne, glasses, and a personalized note.
    *   They created a viral video campaign showing the emotional reactions of borrowers receiving their kits.
    *   They partnered with local real estate agents to deliver the kits in person, creating a memorable experience for both the borrower and the agent.
*   **Results:**
    *   Brand awareness increased by 200% in their target market.
    *   Referrals from real estate agents doubled.
    *   The campaign generated significant social media buzz, further amplifying their reach.

## 6. Potential Pitfalls and Criticisms

While the *Made to Stick* framework is powerful, it is not without its limitations. It is important to be aware of these potential pitfalls when applying the principles to the mortgage industry.

*   **Oversimplification:** In a highly regulated industry like mortgages, oversimplification can lead to compliance issues. It is crucial to ensure that all communications are not only simple but also accurate and compliant.
*   **The "Curse of Knowledge":** The biggest barrier to creating simple messages is the "curse of knowledge." Loan officers know so much about mortgages that it is difficult for them to imagine what it's like to not know. Overcoming this requires a conscious effort to see the process from the borrower's perspective.
*   **Authenticity:** If not done authentically, attempts to be emotional or unexpected can come across as manipulative or gimmicky. All communications should be genuine and aligned with the company's brand and values.

## 7. Conclusion

The mortgage industry is at a critical juncture. The old way of communicating is no longer working. The *Made to Stick* framework provides a clear and proven path forward. By embracing the principles of Simplicity, Unexpectedness, Concreteness, Credibility, Emotion, and Stories, mortgage professionals can transform their communication, build stronger relationships with their clients, and create a sustainable business built on trust and referrals.

The opportunity is immense. The first mortgage companies to truly master the art of sticky communication will not only win the hearts and minds of their customers but will also become the leaders in the next generation of the mortgage industry.
