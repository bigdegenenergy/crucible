# Mortgage Industry Communication Challenges and Made to Stick Applications

## Critical Communication Problems in Mortgage Industry

### Top Borrower Frustrations (STRATMOR Group Research, 2022)

**Communication is the #1 Problem:**
- **24% of borrowers** who had problems attributed them to communication issues
- Communication problems cause Net Promoter Score (NPS) to drop to **-60**
- This virtually eliminates chances of referrals and likely causes negative word-of-mouth

**Secondary Communication-Related Problems:**
1. **Document requests (23%)** - Would go smoother if reasoning was clearly communicated
2. **Underwriting issues (19%)** - Often cited because originator passes blame
3. **Closing issues (18%)** - Would be fewer if borrower received better communication about expectations

### The Three Communication Pitfalls (The Trifecta of Bad Communication)

#### 1. SILENCE - Not Communicating Enough
**Impact:**
- When borrower feels they need to call lender for updates: **NPS drops 83 points**
- When borrower doesn't receive phone call about final numbers before closing: **NPS drops 98 points**

**Solution:** Proactive outreach turns disgruntled borrowers into advocates

#### 2. INACCURATE INFORMATION - Sharing Wrong Details
**Impact:**
- Failure to ask for right documentation upfront: **NPS drops 20 points**
- Failure to clearly explain subsequent documentation requests (happens on 1 in 3 loans): **NPS drops 47 points**

**Solution:** 
- Learn to better communicate need for subsequent requests
- Educate on underwriting guidelines to reduce subsequent requests

#### 3. BLAME SHIFTING - Throwing Others Under the Bus
**Impact:**
- When borrowers cite "underwriting" as problem: **NPS is -21**
- Even if LO receives high personal rating, borrower won't promote the company
- More likely to badmouth company than promote it

**Misconception:** LOs think advocacy/loyalty tied solely to their personal performance vs. whole loan process

**Reality:** Like a waiter throwing chef under the bus - customer may like waiter but won't rave about restaurant

### The Opportunity

**Borrowers who go through loan process WITHOUT these pitfalls:**
- **NPS score of 97** - true "raving fan" advocates
- Exponential growth in referral base

## Financial Services Storytelling Applications

### Six Principles of Sticky Financial Storytelling (Point Road Group, 2025)

Financial leaders operate in dual communication modes:
- **Direct numbers mode:** Quarterly reports, regulatory filings, KPIs - clarity and precision
- **Storytelling mode:** Board presentations, stakeholder updates, organizational change - narratives transform understanding

#### 1. Tell a Story
**Structure:** Problem → Action → Result

**Traditional (Bad):**
"Q2 saw a 15% improvement in working capital efficiency, with DSO reduced from 45 to 38 days."

**Story-Driven (Good):**
"Imagine walking into our largest distribution center last year. You'd see $50 million in inventory gathering dust—money literally sitting on shelves. Fast forward to today: that same warehouse is half-empty, yet we're shipping more products than ever. How? We discovered that our payment terms were forcing us to stockpile inventory. By restructuring these terms, we freed up $25 million—capital that's now funding our Asia expansion. One change, three wins: happier customers, lower costs, and faster growth."

#### 2. Simplicity
**Key Question:** What's the one thing they must remember?

**Traditional (Bad):**
"Operating margins increased 300 basis points through various cost optimization initiatives."

**Story-Driven (Good):**
"Every dollar we saved became a dollar we could invest in innovation. Our efficiency program didn't just cut costs—it funded our future."

#### 3. Concrete Details
**Make abstract numbers tangible through relatable comparisons**

**Traditional (Bad):**
"Energy efficiency improved 25% year-over-year"

**Story-Driven (Good):**
"The energy we saved last year could power every home in Boston for a month. That's not just sustainability—it's $10 million back into our growth initiatives."

#### 4. Unexpectedness
**Break patterns to capture attention**

**Traditional (Bad):**
"Customer acquisition costs decreased by 30%"

**Story-Driven (Good):**
"We were convinced we needed to spend more on marketing. Then we discovered something surprising: our best customers came from our lowest-cost channel. By doubling down there, we cut acquisition costs by a third while growing faster than ever."

#### 5. Credibility
**Balance data with real-world validation**

**Traditional (Bad):**
"Employee retention increased 15% post-implementation."

**Story-Driven (Good):**
"When our senior engineers started mentoring new hires, something remarkable happened. Not only did training costs drop 15%, but our retention rate hit an all-time high. The numbers told us what happened—our teams showed us why."

#### 6. Emotional Connection
**Link financial outcomes to human impact**

**Traditional (Bad):**
"Cost savings enabled continued operations during market downturn."

**Story-Driven (Good):**
"Last winter, when our competitors were laying off staff, our efficiency program let us make a bold promise: no layoffs. The result? Record productivity and the highest employee engagement scores in our history."

## Key Insights for Mortgage Business Application

### The Complexity Challenge
- Mortgage industry faces unique challenge: highly complex, regulated product
- Borrowers often don't understand process, terminology, or requirements
- **Curse of Knowledge** is especially acute - LOs know too much, assume borrowers understand

### The Stakes Are High
- Unlike many products, mortgages involve:
  - Largest financial decision most people make
  - Complex legal and financial implications
  - Emotional investment (buying a home)
  - Long, multi-step process with many parties involved
  - High anxiety and stress for borrowers

### The Communication Gap
- Industry gravitates toward jargon and technical language
- "DSO," "basis points," "underwriting guidelines," "DTI ratio," etc.
- Borrowers left confused and frustrated
- Communication problems are NOT about lack of effort - they're about poor MESSAGE DESIGN

### The Opportunity
- Mortgage industry is RIPE for Made to Stick principles
- Current communication is at the "nonprofit pole" (abstract, jargon-filled, forgettable)
- Opportunity to move toward "sticky pole" (simple, concrete, memorable)
- Small improvements in communication can yield massive NPS gains
