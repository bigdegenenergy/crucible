# Made to Stick: Case Studies and Examples from the Book

## Major Case Studies

### 1. The Kidney Heist Urban Legend
**Category:** Urban Legend that demonstrates all SUCCESs principles

**Story:**
- Business traveler (Dave) in Atlantic City for meeting
- Attractive woman buys him drinks at bar
- Wakes up in hotel bathtub filled with ice
- Note says "Don't move. Call 911"
- Cell phone on table beside bathtub
- 911 operator asks him to reach behind - finds tube protruding from lower back
- One kidney harvested by organ thieves

**Why It Sticks:**
- **Simple:** Clear, straightforward narrative
- **Unexpected:** Highly unexpected outcome from accepting a drink
- **Concrete:** Ice-filled bathtub, tube from back, specific details
- **Credible:** "Friend of a friend" framing, specific details add believability
- **Emotional:** Fear, disgust, suspicion
- **Story:** Complete narrative with setup, conflict, and resolution

**Test:** Close the book, wait an hour, tell a friend - you'll remember all important details without rereading

### 2. Movie Popcorn Campaign (CSPI - 1992)
**Organization:** Center for Science in the Public Interest
**Leader:** Art Silverman

**The Problem:**
- Movie popcorn contained 37 grams of saturated fat
- USDA recommends max 20 grams per day
- Culprit: coconut oil used for popping
- Challenge: "37 grams of saturated fat" is meaningless to most people
- "Saturated fat has zero appeal - it's dry, it's academic, who cares?"

**The Solution (Press Conference - September 27, 1992):**
Message: "A medium-sized 'butter' popcorn at a typical neighborhood movie theater contains more artery-clogging fat than a bacon-and-eggs breakfast, a Big Mac and fries for lunch, and a steak dinner with all the trimmings — combined!"

Visual: Laid out full buffet of greasy food for TV cameras - entire day's worth of unhealthy eating displayed on a table

**Results:**
- Immediate sensation: CBS, NBC, ABC, CNN coverage
- Front pages: USA Today, LA Times, Washington Post
- Late-night jokes: Leno and Letterman
- Headlines: "Popcorn Gets an 'R' Rating," "Lights, Action, Cholesterol!"
- **Behavior Change:** Sales plunged, moviegoers avoided popcorn
- **Industry Change:** Major chains (United Artists, AMC, Loews) stopped using coconut oil

**SUCCESs Analysis:**
- **Simple:** One clear comparison
- **Unexpected:** Popcorn = full day of bad eating
- **Concrete:** Visual display of actual food items
- **Credible:** Lab results from reputable nonprofit
- **Emotional:** Disgust at the unhealthiness
- **Story:** Problem (hidden danger) and solution (awareness)

### 3. JFK Moon Landing Speech (1961)
**Context:** Government mission statement

**The Message:**
"Put a man on the moon and return him safely to the earth by the end of the decade"

**Why It Worked:**
- **Simple:** Clear, single objective
- **Concrete:** Specific, tangible goal (not abstract like "maximize shareholder value")
- **Unexpected:** Ambitious, seemingly impossible goal
- **Emotional:** National pride, competition with USSR
- **Credible:** Presidential authority, specific timeline

**Contrast with Bad Example:**
Typical CEO parlance: "Maximize shareholder value" - abstract, meaningless, no clear action

**Impact:** Fueled US space efforts for an entire decade

### 4. Nordstrom Customer Service Stories
**Company:** Nordstrom department stores
**Reputation:** "World-class customer service"

**How They Make It Sticky:**
Tell concrete stories instead of abstract principles

**Famous Example - The Tire Return:**
Nordstrom employee accepted used snow tires from a customer who wanted to return them, even though Nordstrom doesn't sell tires

**Another Example - Gift Wrapping:**
A Nordstrom employee ("Nordie") cheerfully gift-wrapped a present the customer bought at a competing store

**Why Stories Work Better Than Policy:**
- Going through orientation as "just another salesperson"
- Hearing "customer service is #1" (abstract, forgettable)
- Then being surprised by concrete stories that demonstrate what that actually means
- Stories provide specific behavioral examples employees can emulate

**SUCCESs Analysis:**
- **Simple:** Core message is clear customer service
- **Unexpected:** Going beyond normal expectations
- **Concrete:** Specific actions, not abstract principles
- **Credible:** Real stories from real employees
- **Emotional:** Surprise, delight, pride
- **Story:** Complete narratives with characters and actions

### 5. Southwest Airlines Commander's Intent
**Concept:** Commander's Intent (CI) from military strategy

**Southwest's CI:**
"We are THE low-fare airline"

**Why It Works:**
- Very short and simple sentence
- Sums up overarching goal of organization
- Functions as filter for localized decision-making
- Nobody would think to gift trinkets on board because it's not in line with the CI
- Employees can make decisions aligned with core mission

**Contrast:**
Bill Clinton's campaign: "It's the economy, stupid" - so everyone knew what to focus on

### 6. Disney "Cast Members" Metaphor
**Concept:** Analogies and metaphors simplify complex issues

**Disney's Approach:**
- Calls staff in their parks "cast members"
- Projects parks as theaters

**Why It Works:**
- Doesn't need to explain why it's important to behave a certain way
- "Being a cast member" reminds everyone they're always on stage
- Simple metaphor drives behavior without lengthy explanations

### 7. Seatbelt/Buckle-Up Campaign
**Category:** Unexpected attention-grabbing

**Approach:** Used unexpected, dramatic imagery to grab attention about car safety

**Principle:** Break patterns to get attention, surprise to increase alertness

### 8. Wendy's "Where's the Beef?" Campaign
**Strategy:** Testable credibility

**Approach:**
- Prodded consumers to experience firsthand (or confirm from others who tried)
- Their burgers had more beef meat than competitors
- Made verifiable claims consumers could test themselves

**Credibility Type:** Testable experience (like Reagan's "Are you better off than 5 years ago?")

### 9. Ronald Reagan 1980 Presidential Debate
**Context:** Debate against Jimmy Carter
**Topic:** Economic sluggishness

**What He Could Have Done:**
Cited innumerable statistics demonstrating economic problems

**What He Actually Did:**
Asked one simple question: "Before you vote, ask yourself if you are better off today than you were four years ago?"

**Why It Worked:**
- **Credible:** Allowed voters to test for themselves
- **Simple:** One clear question
- **Concrete:** Personal experience vs. abstract statistics
- **Emotional:** Connected to personal feelings about their situation

**Lesson:** Hard numbers are often the WRONG approach. Personal testability is more powerful.

### 10. Mother Teresa Donation Principle
**Research Finding:**
People donate more to a single needy individual than to an entire impoverished region

**Quote (paraphrased):**
"People will do for the one what they will not do for the many"

**Explanation:**
- Numbers appeal to analytical brain
- Stories appeal to emotional centers
- When people were asked to perform calculus, donations decreased even with emotional story
- Combining story with data did NOT produce better results

**Application:**
Tell story about single child rather than statistics about millions affected

**Lesson:** Know when to use logic vs. emotion, but don't blend them

### 11. Missile Accuracy Example
**Challenge:** Explain how accurate a missile is

**Bad Approach:**
"It can be shot from the sun and hit within a km of the target"
- Problem: People have no idea of sun-earth distance

**Good Approach:**
"It goes from New York to LA and hits within 5cm"
- Humanized the distance using familiar reference points

**Principle:** Contextualize statistics in human-scale terms

### 12. Nonprofit Driver Surprise
**Strategy:** Testable credibility without audience knowing

**Approach:**
- Nonprofit picked up potential donors to meet them
- Told them how successful they were turning homeless people into honest workers
- Revealed their driver was one of those success stories

**Why It Worked:**
- Donors experienced the credibility firsthand without knowing
- Concrete proof vs. abstract claims
- Emotional impact of surprise revelation

## Additional Examples from Book

### Speed Movie Pitch
**Technique:** Link new idea to something familiar

**Pitch:** "Die Hard on a bus"

**Why It Works:** Concrete reference to known movie helps Hollywood producers immediately understand concept

### Alien Movie Pitch
**Pitch:** "Jaws on a spaceship"

**Same Principle:** Familiar + twist = instant comprehension

### Smoke Detector Marketing (Joseph Sugarman)
**Challenge:** Sell first and unknown smoke detectors

**Solution:** Pitch them as "electronic noses"

**Why It Worked:** Linked new technology to familiar concept (nose that smells smoke)

### Robert Cialdini's Teaching Method
**Technique:** Use mysteries to maintain attention

**Approach:**
- Introduce mysteries in lectures
- Create need for closure
- Keep students engaged through curiosity gaps
- Systematically open gaps in knowledge, then fill them

**Application:** How to keep students engaged during 48th history class of the year

## Key Patterns Across Case Studies

### What Makes Ideas Stick:
1. **Concrete beats abstract** (popcorn = day of greasy food, not "37 grams")
2. **Stories beat statistics** (single child > millions affected)
3. **Testable beats told** (Reagan's question > economic statistics)
4. **Unexpected beats expected** (tire return at non-tire store)
5. **Simple beats complex** (moon landing > maximize shareholder value)
6. **Emotional beats rational** (disgust > nutritional data)

### What Kills Ideas:
1. **Curse of knowledge** - experts can't remember what it's like not to know
2. **Abstract language** - "comprehensive community building," "return-on-investment rationale"
3. **Jargon** - "CCIs," "categorical requirements in grant making"
4. **Raw statistics** - "37 grams of saturated fat" without context
5. **Complexity** - too many points dilute the message

### Common Mistakes:
1. **Blending logic and emotion** - doesn't improve results, pick one
2. **Grabbing attention unrelated to content** - attention must relate to message
3. **Too many details** - curse of knowledge makes experts over-explain
4. **Relying on repetition** - crutch for poorly designed ideas (urban legends don't need repetition)
