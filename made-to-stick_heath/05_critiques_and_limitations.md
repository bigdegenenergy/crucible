# Made to Stick: Critiques and Limitations

## Overview

While *Made to Stick* by Chip and Dan Heath is widely praised and has become a foundational text in marketing and communication, it is important to understand its limitations and potential pitfalls when applying the SUCCESs framework.

## Key Critiques

### 1. Risk of Oversimplification

The most significant critique of the *Made to Stick* framework is the risk of oversimplifying complex ideas to the point where they lose accuracy or nuance. The principle of **Simplicity** encourages stripping ideas down to their core, but this can be dangerous in regulated industries like finance, healthcare, or legal services.

**Example:** In the mortgage industry, simplifying "APR" to just "the real cost of your loan" might be memorable, but it omits critical details about how APR is calculated and what it includes, potentially leading to misunderstandings or compliance violations.

**Mitigation:** Always verify that simplified messages remain accurate and compliant. Use simplicity to make ideas accessible, not to hide complexity.

### 2. The "Curse of Knowledge" is Hard to Overcome

The Heath brothers identify the "curse of knowledge" as a major barrier to communication—once you know something, it's hard to imagine not knowing it. However, the book doesn't provide a systematic method for overcoming this curse beyond awareness.

**Challenge:** Experts in technical fields (mortgage underwriting, financial planning, software engineering) often struggle to recognize what is jargon and what is common knowledge.

**Mitigation:** Test messages with actual target audiences before deploying them widely. Use feedback loops and user testing.

### 3. Not All Ideas Need to Be Sticky

The framework assumes that making ideas "sticky" is always the goal, but there are situations where stickiness is not the primary objective. Some communications need to be functional, not memorable.

**Example:** Legal disclosures, terms and conditions, or technical specifications don't need to be "sticky"—they need to be accurate and comprehensive.

**Mitigation:** Recognize when stickiness is the goal and when other communication objectives (clarity, completeness, compliance) take precedence.

### 4. Emotional Manipulation Concerns

The **Emotional** principle can be powerful, but it also raises ethical concerns. Using emotion to manipulate people into action, especially in commercial contexts, can backfire if perceived as inauthentic or exploitative.

**Example:** Fear-based marketing (e.g., "You'll never retire if you don't buy our product") can be sticky but may damage trust and brand reputation.

**Mitigation:** Use emotion authentically and ethically. Connect to genuine values and aspirations, not manufactured fears.

### 5. Cultural and Contextual Limitations

The examples in *Made to Stick* are primarily drawn from American business and marketing contexts. The principles may not translate directly to other cultures or contexts where communication norms differ.

**Example:** The **Unexpected** principle relies on violating expectations, but what's unexpected in one culture may be offensive or confusing in another.

**Mitigation:** Adapt the principles to local cultural contexts. Test messages with diverse audiences.

### 6. Lack of Empirical Validation

While the Heath brothers cite research on memory and persuasion, the SUCCESs framework itself has not been rigorously tested in controlled academic studies. The evidence is largely anecdotal and based on case studies.

**Critique:** Some academics argue that the framework is more of a useful heuristic than a scientifically validated model.

**Response:** The framework's value lies in its practical utility, not its scientific rigor. It provides a useful checklist for crafting messages, even if it's not a predictive model.

## Common Misapplications

### 1. Applying All Six Principles to Every Message

**Mistake:** Trying to make every message Simple, Unexpected, Concrete, Credible, Emotional, AND Story-driven.

**Reality:** Not every message needs all six elements. Some messages benefit from simplicity and concreteness but don't need a story. Forcing all six can make messages feel contrived.

**Best Practice:** Use the SUCCESs framework as a checklist, not a requirement. Apply the principles that fit the message and context.

### 2. Confusing "Sticky" with "Viral"

**Mistake:** Assuming that sticky ideas will automatically go viral or spread widely.

**Reality:** Stickiness (memorability) and virality (shareability) are related but distinct. An idea can be memorable without being widely shared, and vice versa.

**Best Practice:** If the goal is virality, also consider Jonah Berger's STEPPS framework (Social Currency, Triggers, Emotion, Public, Practical Value, Stories).

### 3. Neglecting the Audience

**Mistake:** Focusing so much on making the message sticky that you forget to consider what the audience actually needs or wants to know.

**Reality:** A sticky message that doesn't address the audience's concerns or questions is ultimately ineffective.

**Best Practice:** Start with audience research. Understand their pain points, questions, and motivations before crafting sticky messages.

### 4. Over-Reliance on Analogies

**Mistake:** Using analogies to make ideas concrete, but choosing analogies that don't actually fit or that confuse the audience.

**Reality:** Bad analogies can be worse than no analogies. If the analogy breaks down under scrutiny, it undermines credibility.

**Best Practice:** Test analogies with real audiences. Ensure they illuminate rather than obscure.

## When Made to Stick Doesn't Work

### Situations Where the Framework May Fail:

1. **Highly Technical Audiences:** Experts may find simplified messages patronizing or inaccurate.
2. **Legal or Regulatory Communications:** Compliance requirements may prevent simplification or creativity.
3. **Crisis Communications:** In a crisis, clarity and speed matter more than stickiness.
4. **Internal Technical Documentation:** Engineers and developers need comprehensive, not memorable, documentation.
5. **B2B Complex Sales:** Enterprise buyers may require detailed technical specifications, not sticky stories.

## Balancing Stickiness with Other Goals

The *Made to Stick* framework is most effective when balanced with other communication objectives:

| Communication Goal | When to Prioritize | When to Deprioritize Stickiness |
|:-------------------|:-------------------|:--------------------------------|
| **Memorability** | Marketing campaigns, brand messaging | Legal disclosures, technical docs |
| **Clarity** | Always important | Never deprioritize |
| **Compliance** | Regulated industries | Never compromise compliance for stickiness |
| **Completeness** | Technical documentation | Marketing messages (where brevity matters) |
| **Persuasion** | Sales, fundraising, advocacy | Informational content |
| **Authenticity** | Always important | Never sacrifice authenticity for cleverness |

## Conclusion

The *Made to Stick* framework is a powerful tool for crafting memorable and effective messages, but it is not a panacea. Like any framework, it has limitations and can be misapplied. The key is to use the SUCCESs principles thoughtfully, adapting them to your specific context, audience, and goals. Always prioritize accuracy, authenticity, and ethical communication over pure stickiness.
