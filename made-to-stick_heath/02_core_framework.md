# Made to Stick: SUCCESs Framework and Core Principles

## The SUCCESs Framework

The Heath Brothers identified six key principles that make ideas "sticky" - meaning they are understood, remembered, and have lasting impact. The acronym SUCCESs stands for:

**S - Simple**
**U - Unexpected**
**C - Concrete**
**C - Credible**
**E - Emotional**
**S - Stories**

## Detailed Breakdown of Each Principle

### 1. SIMPLICITY - Finding the Core

**Core Concept:** Strip ideas down to their essential core through ruthless prioritization.

**Key Quote from Book:** "If you argue ten points, even if each is a good point, when they get back to the jury room they won't remember any."

**Goal:** Create ideas that are both simple AND profound - not just short sound bites.

**Ultimate Model:** The Golden Rule - a one-sentence statement so profound that an individual could spend a lifetime learning to follow it.

**Challenge:** Must be masters of exclusion and relentlessly prioritize. Proverbs are the ideal, not sound bites.

### 2. UNEXPECTEDNESS - Grabbing and Holding Attention

**Core Concept:** Violate people's expectations to grab attention, then generate curiosity to maintain it.

**Two-Part Process:**
- **Surprise:** Use emotion to increase alertness and cause focus (grabs initial attention)
- **Interest/Curiosity:** Systematically "open gaps" in knowledge, then fill those gaps (maintains attention over time)

**Example:** "A bag of popcorn is as unhealthy as a whole day's worth of fatty foods!"

**Application:** How do you keep students engaged during the 48th history class of the year? Open knowledge gaps systematically.

### 3. CONCRETENESS - Making Ideas Clear

**Core Concept:** Explain ideas in terms of human actions and sensory information.

**Why It Matters:** Our brains are wired to remember concrete data, not abstractions.

**Common Failure Point:** Business communication often goes awry here - mission statements, synergies, strategies, visions become "ambiguous to the point of being meaningless."

**Examples of Concrete Language:**
- Ice-filled bathtubs
- Apples with razors
- "A bird in hand is worth two in the bush" (abstract truth encoded concretely)

**Purpose:** Ensure the idea means the same thing to everyone in the audience.

### 4. CREDIBILITY - Making People Believe

**Core Concept:** Sticky ideas must carry their own credentials when we don't have natural authority.

**Key Strategies:**
- Enable people to test ideas for themselves ("try before you buy" for ideas)
- Use internal credibility rather than external statistics
- Create self-validating mechanisms

**Famous Example:** Ronald Reagan's 1980 debate question: "Before you vote, ask yourself if you are better off today than you were four years ago?"
- Could have cited numerous statistics about economic sluggishness
- Instead, asked a simple question that allowed voters to test for themselves

**Insight:** Hard numbers are often the WRONG approach. Personal testability is more powerful.

### 5. EMOTIONS - Making People Care

**Core Concept:** Make people feel something about the idea.

**Key Research Finding:** People are more likely to make charitable gifts to a single needy individual than to an entire impoverished region.

**Why:** We are wired to feel things for people, not for abstractions.

**Challenge:** Finding the right emotion to harness.

**Example - Movie Popcorn:** Made people feel disgusted by its unhealthiness. "37 grams of saturated fat" doesn't elicit emotions, but comparing it to a full day of greasy food does.

**Example - Teen Smoking:** Difficult to get teenagers to quit by instilling fear of consequences, but easier by tapping into their resentment of Big Tobacco's duplicity.

### 6. STORIES - Driving Action

**Core Concept:** Stories act as mental flight simulators, preparing us to respond more quickly and effectively.

**How It Works:**
- Firefighters naturally swap stories after every fire
- By doing so, they multiply their experience
- After years of hearing stories, they have a richer mental catalog of critical situations and appropriate responses

**Research Backing:** Mentally rehearsing a situation helps us perform better when we encounter that situation in the physical environment.

**Purpose:** Stories help people ACT on ideas, not just understand them.

## The Villain: Curse of Knowledge

**Definition:** Once we know something, it's hard to imagine what it was like not to know it.

**Impact:** Makes it difficult to communicate effectively because we can't recreate the beginner's mindset.

**Metaphor:** "It's hard to be a tapper" - referring to an experiment where people tap out songs and expect others to recognize them, but listeners can't hear the melody in their heads.

## Key Case Studies Mentioned

### 1. The Kidney Heist Urban Legend

**Story Elements:**
- Friend of a friend (classic urban legend opening)
- Business traveler in Atlantic City
- Attractive woman buys him drinks
- Wakes up in ice-filled bathtub
- Note: "Don't move. Call 911"
- Tube protruding from lower back
- One kidney harvested by organ thieves

**Why It Sticks:**
- **Unexpected:** Highly unexpected outcome
- **Concrete:** Vivid details (ice-filled bathtub, tube from back)
- **Emotional:** Fear, disgust, suspicion
- **Story:** Complete narrative arc

**Test:** Close the book, take an hour break, tell a friend - you'll remember all the important details.

### 2. Movie Popcorn Campaign (CSPI)

**Background:**
- Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI) research
- Art Silverman's challenge: communicate that movie popcorn is unhealthy
- Lab results: typical bag had 37 grams of saturated fat
- USDA recommends max 20 grams per day
- Culprit: coconut oil used for popping

**The Problem:**
- "37 grams of saturated fat" means nothing to most people
- "Saturated fat has zero appeal - it's dry, it's academic, who cares?"
- Could have made bar graphs (too scientific, too rational)
- The amount of fat was ludicrous, needed to communicate that ludicrousness

**The Solution (September 27, 1992 press conference):**
"A medium-sized 'butter' popcorn at a typical neighborhood movie theater contains more artery-clogging fat than a bacon-and-eggs breakfast, a Big Mac and fries for lunch, and a steak dinner with all the trimmings — combined!"

**Visual Component:**
- Laid out full buffet of greasy food for TV cameras
- Entire day's worth of unhealthy eating displayed on a table
- All that saturated fat stuffed into a single bag of popcorn

**Results:**
- Immediate sensation: CBS, NBC, ABC, CNN
- Front pages: USA Today, LA Times, Washington Post
- Leno and Letterman jokes
- Headlines: "Popcorn Gets an 'R' Rating," "Lights, Action, Cholesterol!"
- **Behavior Change:** Moviegoers avoided popcorn in droves, sales plunged
- **Industry Change:** United Artists, AMC, Loews stopped using coconut oil

**Why It Worked:**
- **Simple:** One clear comparison
- **Unexpected:** Popcorn = full day of bad eating
- **Concrete:** Visual display of actual food
- **Credible:** Lab results from reputable source
- **Emotional:** Disgust
- **Story:** Had narrative structure with problem and solution

## Comparison: Sticky vs. Non-Sticky Ideas

**Sticky (Kidney Heist, Movie Popcorn):**
- Memorable without repetition
- Understood and retold accurately
- Changes behavior
- Requires no resources to spread

**Non-Sticky (Example from nonprofit):**
"Comprehensive community building naturally lends itself to a return-on-investment rationale that can be modeled, drawing on existing practice... [a] factor constraining the flow of resources to CCIs is that funders must often resort to targeting or categorical requirements in grant making to ensure accountability."

- Impossible to remember or retell
- Abstract and jargon-filled
- No emotional resonance
- No concrete imagery

## Core Philosophy: Nature vs. Nurture

**Question:** Are ideas born interesting or made interesting?

**Answer:** Made to Stick is a "nurture book" - ideas can be MADE sticky through intentional design.

**Insight:** The ridiculous Kidney Heist tale keeps circulating with no resources, while good ideas often struggle. This suggests it's not about the inherent interest of the topic, but how the idea is crafted.

## When Do We Need Sticky Ideas?

**Frequency:** Most people need to make ideas stick 12-52 times per year (once a month to once a week).

**Examples:**
- **Managers:** Communicating new strategic directions and behavioral guidelines
- **Teachers:** Conveying themes, conflicts, trends that endure beyond individual facts
- **Columnists:** Changing readers' opinions on policy issues
- **Religious leaders:** Sharing spiritual wisdom
- **Nonprofits:** Persuading volunteers and donors to contribute

**Note:** Not every idea needs to be sticky. "Pass the gravy" doesn't need to be memorable.

## Common Communication Advice (and Its Limitations)

**Traditional Advice:**
- Delivery: Stand up straight, make eye contact, use hand gestures, practice
- Structure: "Tell 'em what you're going to tell 'em..."
- Opening: Start with a joke or story to get attention
- Audience: Know what your listeners care about
- Repetition: Repeat, repeat, repeat

**Limitations:**
- Doesn't help with MESSAGE DESIGN
- Doesn't help Art Silverman figure out how to explain movie popcorn is unhealthy
- Assumes you already have a good idea to communicate
- Repetition is often a crutch for poorly designed ideas (urban legends don't need repetition)

**What's Missing:** Guidance on how to CRAFT the message itself to be inherently memorable and impactful.

## Key Takeaway

The SUCCESs framework provides a systematic approach to designing ideas that stick. It's not about having inherently interesting topics or massive resources - it's about crafting messages using these six principles to maximize understanding, memory, and impact.
