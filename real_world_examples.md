## Implications for Mortgage Industry

### What We Can Learn:

1. **Mortgage Industry is Opposite of These Examples**
   - Industry uses jargon, not simple language
   - Expected, not unexpected
   - Abstract (rates, points, APR), not concrete
   - Relies on authority, not testable experience
   - Rational, not emotional
   - No stories, just transactions

2. **Massive Opportunity**
   - If these principles work across diverse industries (cereal, socks, software, nonprofits)
   - They should work in mortgages too
   - But almost NO ONE is doing it in mortgage space

3. **Low-Hanging Fruit**
   - Competition is weak on communication
   - Small improvements could yield outsized results
   - First mover advantage in "sticky mortgage communication"

4. **The Challenge**
   - Mortgages are complex, regulated products
   - Can't oversimplify to point of inaccuracy
   - Must maintain compliance while being memorable
   - This is the design challenge to solve
