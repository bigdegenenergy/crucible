# Designing Data-Intensive Applications

**Author(s):** Martin Kleppmann

**Category:** Data Engineering / Distributed Systems

## Why This Book?

"Designing Data-Intensive Applications" (DDIA) is widely considered the definitive text on modern data systems architecture. In an era where most applications are data-intensive rather than compute-intensive, understanding how to build reliable, scalable, and maintainable data systems is essential. Kleppmann distills decades of distributed systems research and industry practice into a unified framework for reasoning about databases, message queues, batch processing, and stream processing. The book transcends specific tools to focus on fundamental principles that remain relevant regardless of which technologies emerge or fade.

This book matters because:

- **Interview Essential**: It's the de facto standard for system design interview preparation at major tech companies
- **Practitioner Wisdom**: Kleppmann's experience at LinkedIn and Rapportive grounds abstract concepts in real production challenges
- **Academic Rigor**: Unlike most industry books, DDIA properly cites and explains foundational distributed systems research
- **Technology Agnostic**: Focuses on concepts (LSM-trees, consensus, partitioning) rather than ephemeral tools
