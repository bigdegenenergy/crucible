# One True Customer Campaign
## Internal Culture Initiative Based on Made to Stick Principles

---

## Executive Summary

**Campaign Name:** One True Customer

**Core Philosophy:** In every interaction - with a customer, partner, or colleague - approach the conversation as if this is your one and only customer. Give them your full and absolute attention.

**The Mental Model:** If your entire livelihood depended on this single relationship, how would you show up?

**Why It Works:** This simple, concrete philosophy transforms abstract concepts like "customer service" and "attention to detail" into an actionable mental filter that guides behavior in real-time.

---

## Part 1: The Philosophy

### The Core Idea

> "If this were my only customer - ever - how would I treat them?"

This single question becomes the filter for every decision, every interaction, every moment of service.

### Why "One True Customer" Sticks

Using the SUCCESs framework from *Made to Stick* by Chip and Dan Heath:

| Principle | How "One True Customer" Delivers |
|-----------|----------------------------------|
| **SIMPLE** | One phrase. One question. One filter for all decisions. |
| **UNEXPECTED** | In a world where people feel like ticket numbers, being treated as the ONLY customer violates every expectation. |
| **CONCRETE** | Not "be attentive" but "if you only had ONE customer, would you check your phone during this call?" |
| **CREDIBLE** | Employees can test it themselves. "Try it for one week and notice what changes." |
| **EMOTIONAL** | Connects to pride, craftsmanship, and purpose - the feeling of doing work that matters. |
| **STORIES** | "One True Customer" moments become company legends that spread without effort. |

### The Psychology Behind It

When we have many customers, it's easy to treat each one as a transaction. But when we imagine having only ONE:

- We listen more carefully
- We explain more thoroughly
- We follow up without being asked
- We take ownership instead of passing blame
- We treat their time as precious
- We remember details
- We care about the outcome, not just the process

This isn't about working harder - it's about working with **presence**.

---

## Part 2: Campaign Rollout

### Phase 1: Leadership Alignment (Week 1-2)

**Objective:** Get leadership to embody the philosophy before rollout

**Actions:**
1. Leadership reads this document and discusses
2. Each leader identifies one personal "One True Customer" story from their career
3. Leaders commit to modeling the behavior publicly
4. Leaders identify team members who already exemplify this naturally

**Leadership Talking Points:**
- "This isn't a new policy - it's a lens for how we already want to operate"
- "We're not adding work. We're adding presence."
- "Your job isn't to serve 100 customers adequately. It's to serve each one completely."

---

### Phase 2: Company Launch (Week 3)

**Objective:** Introduce the philosophy to all employees with clarity and emotion

**The Launch Message:**

> Starting today, we operate under a new philosophy: **One True Customer**.
>
> In every conversation - with a client, a partner, a colleague - imagine this is the only customer you'll ever have. Your entire career, your reputation, your livelihood depends on this one relationship.
>
> How would you show up?
>
> Would you rush the call to get to the next one? Would you half-listen while checking email? Would you give a vague answer to avoid doing the work?
>
> Or would you be fully present? Would you listen until you truly understood? Would you follow through without being asked? Would you make them feel like they matter - because they do?
>
> That's how we show up now. Every time. Every interaction.
>
> One True Customer.

**Launch Format Options:**
- All-hands meeting with leadership presenting
- Video message from CEO/Owner
- Team-by-team rollout with managers presenting

---

### Phase 3: Training Integration (Week 4-6)

**Objective:** Make the philosophy actionable through specific behaviors

**Training Session Outline (60-90 minutes):**

#### Opening (10 minutes)
Read this scenario aloud:

> *Imagine tomorrow you wake up and learn that you will only ever have ONE customer for the rest of your career. This one person will determine your income, your reputation, your professional future. Every other customer disappears. Just this one remains.*
>
> *How would you prepare for your first interaction with them? How would you listen? How would you follow up? How thoroughly would you explain things? How quickly would you return their call?*
>
> *That's the One True Customer mindset. And here's the truth: every customer you interact with deserves that level of attention. Because to THEM, in that moment, you ARE their one connection to our company.*

#### The Contrast Exercise (15 minutes)

Have employees discuss in pairs:

| "Just Another Customer" Behavior | "One True Customer" Behavior |
|----------------------------------|------------------------------|
| Checking phone during conversation | Phone face-down, full attention |
| "I'll get back to you" (vague) | "I'll call you by 3pm tomorrow with an answer" |
| Transferring without context | Warm handoff with full background |
| Explaining what, not why | "Here's why we need this document..." |
| Waiting for them to follow up | Proactive update before they ask |
| Rushing to end the interaction | Asking "What else can I help with?" |
| Blame-shifting to other departments | "Let me own this and get you an answer" |

#### The Daily Filter (10 minutes)

Introduce the questions employees should ask themselves:

**Before an interaction:**
- "If this were my only customer, how would I prepare?"

**During an interaction:**
- "Am I fully present right now?"
- "Would I say this / do this if my career depended on this one relationship?"

**After an interaction:**
- "If this were my only customer, would I be proud of how I just handled that?"
- "What would I do differently if I could do it again?"

#### Role-Play Scenarios (20-30 minutes)

Run through 2-3 scenarios relevant to your business. Example for mortgage industry:

**Scenario 1: The Document Request**
> A borrower is frustrated because you're asking for additional bank statements after they already submitted some.

*Standard approach:* "Underwriting needs more documentation."

*One True Customer approach:* "I know it feels like a lot of paperwork, and I want to explain exactly why we need this. The underwriter is making sure your loan is rock-solid - they're actually protecting you from getting into a loan that might not work for you. These additional statements help them verify [specific reason]. Let me walk you through exactly what they're looking for so we can get this done together."

**Scenario 2: The Missed Call**
> You missed a call from a customer. It's now 4:45pm.

*Standard approach:* Wait until tomorrow, it's almost end of day.

*One True Customer approach:* Call back immediately. Even if you can only say "I saw you called and wanted to connect before end of day. How can I help?" Your One True Customer shouldn't wonder if you got their message.

**Scenario 3: The Handoff**
> You need to transfer a customer to another department.

*Standard approach:* "Let me transfer you to processing."

*One True Customer approach:* "I'm going to connect you with Sarah in processing. Before I do, let me give her the full picture so you don't have to repeat yourself. Can you hold for just a moment while I brief her? And here's my direct line in case you need anything else."

#### Story Sharing (10 minutes)

Ask: "Can anyone share a time when YOU were treated like a One True Customer? How did it feel? What did that person do?"

Collect 2-3 stories. These become the seeds of your story library.

#### Close and Commitment (5 minutes)

Have each person write down:
1. One specific behavior they will change this week
2. One situation where they'll consciously apply the One True Customer filter

---

### Phase 4: Reinforcement (Ongoing)

**Objective:** Keep the philosophy alive through stories, recognition, and repetition

#### Weekly Story Sharing

At team meetings, dedicate 5 minutes to:
- "Who has a One True Customer moment to share?"
- Can be something they did OR something a colleague did
- Can be a customer interaction OR internal (treating a colleague as One True Customer)

#### Recognition Program

**"One True Customer" Recognition:**
- Peer-nominated recognition for exemplary moments
- Customer feedback that reflects the philosophy
- Keep recognition simple and frequent, not elaborate and rare

**Sample Recognition Announcement:**
> "This week's One True Customer recognition goes to [Name]. A borrower called confused about their closing disclosure. Instead of giving a quick explanation, [Name] scheduled a 30-minute call, walked through every line item, and followed up the next day to make sure there were no more questions. The borrower wrote: 'I've never felt so taken care of during a financial transaction.' That's One True Customer in action."

#### Visual Reminders

Place the core question where it will be seen:
- Screen savers: "If this were my only customer..."
- Desk cards with the One True Customer question
- Meeting room posters
- Email signature option

#### The 30-Day Challenge

For new hires or team refreshes:

> "For the next 30 days, before every significant interaction, pause and ask: 'If this were my only customer, how would I handle this?' At the end of 30 days, reflect: What changed? What did you notice?"

## Part 3: Story Collection System

### Why Stories Matter

From *Made to Stick*: Stories are mental flight simulators. They prepare people to act. The Nordstrom tire return story does more to communicate their service philosophy than any training manual ever could.

Your goal: Build a library of "One True Customer" stories that spread on their own.

### Story Collection Template

**When capturing a One True Customer moment, record:**

```
DATE: _______________

TEAM MEMBER: _______________

THE SITUATION:
What was happening? What was the customer's need or problem?
_________________________________________________
_________________________________________________

THE ONE TRUE CUSTOMER MOMENT:
What did the team member do that exemplified treating them as their only customer?
_________________________________________________
_________________________________________________

THE IMPACT:
What was the outcome? How did the customer respond?
_________________________________________________
_________________________________________________

THE LESSON:
What does this story teach others about One True Customer behavior?
_________________________________________________
_________________________________________________
```

### Sample Stories to Seed the Culture

**Story 1: The Saturday Call**
> A borrower's loan was scheduled to close Monday, but they discovered a question about their closing costs on Saturday afternoon. They sent an email expecting to wait until Monday. Their loan officer saw the email, called them within the hour, and spent 45 minutes walking through every number. The borrower later said: "I've bought three homes and never had anyone call me on a Saturday. I felt like I was their only client." That's One True Customer.

**Story 2: The Memory**
> A processor noticed that a borrower mentioned in passing that they were nervous about their first home purchase. When the file reached clear to close, the processor included a handwritten note: "Congratulations on your first home! I know you were nervous when we started, but you made it." The borrower posted the note on social media. One small act of remembering turned a transaction into a relationship.

**Story 3: The Internal Customer**
> A loan officer needed rush processing on a file. Instead of just marking it urgent, they called the processor, explained the borrower's situation (relocating for a new job, timing was critical), and asked "What do you need from me to make this smooth for you?" The processor later said: "That's the first time someone treated ME like a customer. I moved mountains to get that file done."

## Part 4: Measuring Success

### Leading Indicators (Behavioral)

Track weekly/monthly:
- Number of One True Customer stories collected
- Peer recognitions given
- Training completion rates
- Self-reported behavior changes

### Lagging Indicators (Results)

Track monthly/quarterly:
- Net Promoter Score (NPS) changes
- Customer satisfaction ratings
- Referral rates
- Customer complaints related to communication
- Employee engagement scores

### The Ultimate Test

From *Made to Stick*: Ideas that stick don't need resources to spread.

**Ask:** Are employees naturally using the phrase "One True Customer" in conversation? Are they asking the question without prompting? Are stories spreading without formal channels?

If yes, it's working.

---

## Part 5: Addressing Challenges

### "But I have too many customers to treat each one this way"

**Response:** One True Customer isn't about spending more TIME with each customer. It's about being fully PRESENT in the time you have. A five-minute call with full attention beats a 30-minute call with distraction.

### "What about difficult customers?"

**Response:** Especially difficult customers. If this truly were your only customer and they were upset, you couldn't fire them. You'd have to find a way to understand them, address their concerns, and repair the relationship. That's the discipline.

### "This sounds nice but we have metrics to hit"

**Response:** One True Customer actually IMPROVES metrics. Customers who feel genuinely cared for:
- Require fewer follow-up calls (problems get solved the first time)
- Generate more referrals (reducing acquisition costs)
- Complain less (reducing escalations)
- Give higher satisfaction scores

This isn't in conflict with performance - it's the path TO performance.

### "How is this different from 'good customer service'?"

**Response:** "Good customer service" is abstract. It means different things to different people. "One True Customer" is a concrete mental filter that guides specific behavior in real-time. It's the difference between "be nice" and "treat them like your career depends on this one relationship."

---

## Part 6: The One True Customer Pledge

For those who want to formalize their commitment:

> **I commit to the One True Customer philosophy.**
>
> In every interaction - with customers, partners, and colleagues - I will show up as if this were my only customer.
>
> I will be fully present. I will listen until I understand. I will explain until they understand. I will follow through without being asked. I will take ownership instead of passing blame.
>
> I will ask myself: "If this were my only customer, would I be proud of how I handled this?"
>
> And I will act accordingly.
>
> **One True Customer. Every time.**
