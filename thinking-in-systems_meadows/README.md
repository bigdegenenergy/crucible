### Description

A clear, thoughtful, and wide-reaching exploration of complex systems, in theory and in practice. Meadows was a masterful and elegant writer and researcher, and an early voice in systems analysis at MIT and elsewhere. This book, completed from draft manuscript after Meadows' death, is both accessible and deeply thought-provoking. She connects the dots between careful descriptions of systems analysis and systems insights, and the personal, social, societal, and political implications of systems thinking.

### Subjects

`critical thinking`, `systems thinking`, `systems dynamics`, `complex systems`, `policy`, `Sustainable development`, `Environmental education`, `Economic development`, `System analysis`, `Simulation methods`
